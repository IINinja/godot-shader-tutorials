Date Updated: 27-04-2019

Update
--
_The code in the repo is not production ready(in master branch)._

> *This does not mean they aren't performant, just that we need to make them faster or add customizability by simplifying them. *

The current master branch will soon be replaced by new dev branch(which is where the new shader code will be for now)

TODO
--
- Create new more performant,complex and ready to use shaders. 
- Add VisualShader examples.
- Add documented tutorials for each shader to be created. (Not necessarily Video)
